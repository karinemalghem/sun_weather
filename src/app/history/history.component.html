        <p class="card-text">The Sun is a star about 4.57 billion years old, a little less than half of its way on the
          main sequence. The hypothesis of the 1970s, that a supernova would be at the origin of the collapse of the
          nebula that gave birth to the Sun, is no longer credible. A recent modeling (2012) proposes a three-step
          scenario to explain the formation of the Sun and the abundance of magnesium 26 and nickel 60 in meteorites.
          These elements are the products of the decomposition of two radioactive isotopes (with a relatively short
          half-life), born in the stars: aluminum 26 (half-life of 717 000 years) and iron 60 (half-life of 2 , 6 Ma).
          To understand the presence of these elements in the chemistry of the Sun, it was necessary to imagine a step
          for iron 60 and another for aluminum 26.</p>

        <p class="card-text">When it is 10.5 billion years old, the hydrostatic balance will be broken. The sun will have converted all the hydrogen of its heart into helium. The helium nucleus will shrink and heat up strongly, while an outer corona of the core will fuse hydrogen into helium. Its superficial layers, dilated by the increasing thermal flux and thus partially liberated from the gravitational effect, will be gradually pushed back: the Sun will dilate, first slowly over 500 million years, then more rapidly over 500 million additional years , to finally turn into a red giant. At the end of this process, the Sun will have a diameter about 100 times greater than the current one, and will be nearly 2,000 times brighter. His photosphere will exceed the orbit of Mercury and Venus. The Earth, if it still remains, will be nothing more than a calcined desert. This phase of giant red will last about 1 billion years, the Sun will lose about one third of its mass.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The melting period of helium will last about 100 million years, the helium nuclei will combine three by three to form carbon cores, which will populate the heart of the red giant, with production of a few oxygen by adding an additional helium nucleus to the carbon. During this phase, the Sun will become bigger and brighter again.</p>

            <p>Finally, when the helium in the center of the heart is completely transformed into carbon and oxygen, it will become a red giant, it will be the phase of the asymptotic branch of the giant, which will last approximately 20 million years. In this phase, 2 melting crowns will take place in its heart: an external fusion hydrogen, an internal fusing helium. In this configuration, the Sun will be very unstable: the fusion crowns alternately varying in power. This will produce powerful pulses that will eventually blow the outer layers. The Sun will have lost about half of its mass.</p>

            <p>The Sun will not be massive enough to compress its carbon core enough and reach the temperature of 600 million K needed for carbon fusion, producing neon, sodium and magnesium30.</p>

The planetary nebula will be a cloud of very hot gas (more than 10,000 K) consisting essentially of hydrogen and helium not consumed in the fusions, and a little carbon. It will serve as a cradle for new stars. The carbon core, having no more fuel to provide the energy needed to counteract gravity, will collapse on itself and form a white dwarf, of a size comparable to that of the Earth. The density will be so high that the heart will house degenerate electronic matter. The surface temperature of the white dwarf will reach 50 000 K (heat stored during the collapse of the heart). This heat will be emitted by a white radiation. The radiative surface being extremely weak, the white dwarf will take several billion years to cool down. When the temperature is low enough, the heat radiation will be so low that the white dwarf will be invisible. She will end her life in black dwarf, a celestial corpse so cold that it emits no light.</p>
